# My-Education-My-Journey
A website that helps low-income and Immigrant students fund their education.

Programming languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This project is a web application designed to assist low-income and immigrant students in identifying scholarships they are eligible for. By inputting responses such as immigration status, GPA, and residency, users receive a customized list of scholarships tailored to their circumstances. The application evaluates each scholarship's eligibility criteria against user inputs and displays relevant results, complete with descriptions of each scholarship. This tool aims to support students from immigrant backgrounds in finding and applying for financial aid opportunities that align with their qualifications and needs.

Historically, immigrant students have faced significant barriers in accessing higher education due to financial constraints and systemic challenges. This tool aims to bridge that gap by providing targeted scholarship opportunities, supporting students who have been historically disadvantaged, and helping them achieve their educational goals.
